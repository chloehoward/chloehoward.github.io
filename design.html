     </p> 
      <p>These menu boards were designed in the process of the Franklin Fountain's opening of their Franklin Ice Cream Bar storefront. The typographic and aesthetic choices are inspired by sign paintings and advertisements of 1930’s and 40’s sign painting. The design had to be eye catching, as well as easy to read and understand from a distance, and was made to fit within the preexisting cut out shapes. It utilizes the colors of red, black, and white to reflect the prominent colors of the space. The design was then scaled up and painted on the boards. The menu signs were prominently featured in early press for Franklin Ice Cream Bar’s opening. </p>

<b>Event Menu Sign</b> - Franklin Ice Cream Bar
    <br>
    This menu sign is a portable version of the Franklin Ice Cream Bar menu for pop-up events. The design needed to capture the 1930’s and 40’s Art Deco aesthetic, but is vectorized so it can be printed at a variety of sizes based on the need of the particular event. Instead of a traditional menu layout, the ice cream bars are broken down into larger highlighted steps with ingredient options underneath. It utilizes the brand’s color scheme of red, black, and white.

    <p>These labels are customizable packaging for wedding chocolate orders. The aesthetic choices are inspired by packaging and advertisements of the Edwardian era (1900-1910). They are made so the text can be easily customized, then printed in house and placed onto the chocolates’ packaging. The different shape options are made to accommodate types of packaging required for various orders.
        <br>
This image shows two different “brand” options. The blue stickers feature Shane Confectionery's in house type and color branding. The designs on the brown background are made to match Shane Confectionery’s “Chocolate Works” line of small batch in-house chocolate, the products of which feature more ornamental graphics on kraft paper packaging.</p>

<b>"Made in Philly" Stickers</b> - the Franklin Fountain
    <br>These stickers are made to be placed on a variety of food products produced by Franklin Fountain and sold throughout their multiple storefronts of Shane Confectionery, the Franklin Fountain, and Franklin Ice Cream Bar; as well as any satellite pop-ups. Because it is being used across multiple storefronts, the graphic needed to have a retro aesthetic but be simple enough to carry across the various eras represented by each storefront.

      <p>This graphic is a print advertisement to frame and place near the ordering register at the Franklin Ice Cream Bar. It is made to encourage customers of Franklin Ice Cream Bar to visit the Franklin Fountain’s other neighboring storefronts. The design choices of layout and type were based off of print and newspaper advertisements of the 1930’s and 40’s. The graphic utilizes the black and red color branding, the other primary colors of blue and yellow were brought in to add depth while still staying true to color sensibilities of that era’s print advertising.
          <p class="aligncenter"><img src="Content/images/design/franklinsocial.jpg" width="75%" height="auto"></p>
        <p>The character featured in this graphic was designed as a “mascot” for the Franklin Ice Cream Bar, and was developed during the process of opening the storefront. The unique head shape is drawn from the Franklin Ice Cream Keystone logo, and mimics the shape of Franklin Ice Cream Bar’s hand-dipped keystone shaped ice cream bars. The illustration style is based off of 1930’s cartoon characters; and is a vector graphic in order to be easily edited, resized, and utilized for a variety of graphics. The character illustration is currently utilized as the business icon on social media.</p>

      <p>This image series was a project for a youth educator. The focus is on using the five senses for grounding, and introduces children to the ideas of mindflness in a fun and approachable way. I developed a short line of copy for each of the senses and illustrated a corresponding animal for each.</p>

      <p>The prompt for this book project was to imitate the theme of “A is for…” books, choosing one letter and theme – I went with the theme “F is for Folklore.” Each entry in the book showcases an illustrator and pairs them with a character from folklore whose name begins with the letter “f.” Each spread features an illustration of the character from folklore in a style that draws from the paired artist, while also being in the shape of an "f". On the opposite page are work examples from the original artist, as well as a description. Stitched into the center of each spread is a small booklet that tells the story of the chosen folkloric figure. This book was an exercise in print layout, as well as applying a variety of illustration styles through utilizing Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
